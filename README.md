# pubg-ingame-overlay

A project I have just started, idea is to display players **current ping** in game due to the fact PUBG
does not have a latency function yet.

Aside that, the overlay will also include additional function like FPS display.

If you have any ideasÂ¹ to contribute to the overlay, notify me by creating an [issue](https://github.com/evelystria/pubg-ingame-overlay/issues) on this project.

##### 1 - Ideas that does not modify existing game functions in anyway but rather informative.
